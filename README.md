# Dark mode toggle & some basic transitions
This is a simple project where I’m just learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built a dark mode toggle with a menu bar, some button transitions, and hover effects to practice how different things work together. It’s mostly me messing around with simple ideas and testing how to make things interactive using minimal JavaScript.
